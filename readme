In this repository you can see and understand the basic tensorflow and pytorch commands such as :
TENSORFLOW
a. Construct an n-dimensional tensor in TensorFlow.
b. Compute the sum, mean, or standard deviation of all elements in a tensor.
c. Perform mathematical operations on tensors, such as finding the maximum or minimum
value, or taking the dot product of two tensors.
d. Access and manipulate specific elements or slices of a tensor, and index and slice tensors
based on certain conditions.
e. Define and call functions in TensorFlow, and pass tensors as arguments to functions.
